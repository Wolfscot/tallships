    <h4>What kind of vessel?</h4>
    <p>Vessels participating in The Tall Ships Races are divided into four classes (A to D) according to the size and rigging of the ship.
    Most of the ships are open to visitors. Ships post their opening hours on the pier notification panel, and their opening hours may be subject to change according to dining and service times as well as private functions. Ships do not charge entrance fees</p>
    <p>The Races are open to any monohull vessel of more than 9.14m water line length, provided that at least 50 percent of the crew is aged between 15 and 25 years old and that the vessel meets Sail Training International’s safety equipment requirements. </p>
    <p>People of all abilities can take part, even those with mental and physical disabilities. To take part in the cruise in company, a vessel must also take part in at least one race. Trainees may join for all or a part of the race series.</p>
    <p>The STI definitions is as it follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h6>Class A</h6>
            <p>All square-rigged vessels (barque, barquentine, brig, brigantine or ship rigged) and all other vessel more than 40 metres Length Overall (LOA), regardless of rig. STI classifies its A Class as "all square-rigged vessels and all other vessels over 40 metres (131 ft) length overall (LOA)", in this case STI LOA excludes bowsprit and aft spar. STI defines LOA as "Length overall measured from the fore side of stem post to aft side of stern post, counter or transom"</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h6>Class B</h6>
            <p>Traditionally rigged vessels (i.e. gaff rigged sloops, ketches, yawls and schooners) with an LOA of less than 40 metres and with a waterline length (LWL) of at least 9.14 metres, one good example is Spirit of Bermuda.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h6>Class C</h6>
            <p>Modern rigged vessels (i.e. Bermudan rigged sloops, ketches, yawls and schooners) with an LOA of less than 40 metres and with a waterline length (LWL) of at least 9.14 metres not carrying spinnaker-like sails.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h6>Class D</h6>
            <p>Modern rigged vessels (i.e. Bermudan rigged sloops, ketches, yawls and schooners) with an LOA of less than 40 metres and with a waterline length (LWL) of at least 9.14 metres carrying spinnaker-like sails. There are also a variety of other rules and regulations for the crew, such as ages, and also for a rating rule. There are other sail festivals and races with their own standards, the STI is just one set of standards for their purposes.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

        <p>To reach a port we must sail, sometimes with the wind, and sometimes against it. But we must not drift or lie at anchor</p>
        <p class="author">Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr</p>
    </blockquote>
              
    <p>An older definition of class "A" by the STI was "all square-rigged vessels over 120′ (36.6 m) length overall (LOA). Fore and aft rigged vessels of 160′ (48.8 m) (LOA) and over". By LOA they meant length excluding bowsprit and aft spar.Class "B" was "all fore and aft rigged vessels between 100 and 160 feet in length, and all square rigged vessels under 120′ (36.6 m) (LOA)".</p>

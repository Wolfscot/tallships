Assessment Criteria:
**Site** 
	- Structure: 8 pages
	- Technical implementation
	- Layout - Author layout, 
  code for crew.html is implemented and adapted from previous course 
	- Design - no templates used 
	- Usability - All anchor tags are pointed to current locations (inner and outer),
  navigation is different element, not united with banner.
*	**Content** (quality of content) â€“  All the CSS Code is turned into SASS. All rules of Jekyll and script are learned in the course and in web.
*	**Responsive design** - working with five different media screens:
@media screen and (max-width:600px)    

@media screen and (max-width:1024px)     

@media screen and (min-width: 1025px) and (max-width: 1599px)  

@media screen and (min-width: 1600px)     

@media screen and (min-width: 1900px)

In contacts.html under 1024px the form-image is hidden.
Navigation also worked in a single tab for 1024.
   
* Using **CSS** transitions and animations:
Four animations are currently placed:
  -a sailing ship, permanent for all the content in main.html
  -two shipwrecks, together with title of the pages, this animation is hidden for phone mode.
  -a rotating planet earth in offers.html, this tutorial I`ve watched in youtube.com and implemented in my code.
  -the boxes with anchor tags are shaking in every mode / vessels.html nad events.html/
  
  Transitions: 
  -Site header transition and navigation transition on body load (only javascript here);
  
  
* Using **Sass** variables and mixins: mixins are used in content for responsive design. Variable CSS is related to colours and font size:
* Using **CSS Grids**: CSS Grid is used for the whole structure. Grid areas in layout scss; grid in title animations, and in grid-article scss for the ship shaking boxes.
